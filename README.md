# Image-Classification
This lab assignment is prepared from several resources: the MNIST data set, the Keras library, and the Tensorflow Playground. We thank the creators of these resources for making them available to the public. 


Steps For Coding:


1). Import the data set. 
a). Import TensorFlow, Keras, and dataset of Handwritten digits(MNIST) from Keras. 
b). Split the data into training and testing sets. 
2). Explore and preprocess the data 
a). Understanding about data. 
b). Preprocessed the data and make it applicable for neural networks.
3). Build Sequential Model. 
a). Set up the layers 
i). Use tf.keras.layers function for adding and defining layers of the model 
b). Compile the model 
i). Setup the model by using some measures such as Loss function, Optimizer, Metrics 
4). Train the model 
a). Feed the model 
i). Feed the training Data to Model 
b). Evaluate accuracy 
i). Check the accuracy of the model on test data. 
5). Make prediction 
a). Predict the label of some images 
6). Verify Prediction 
a). Verify the prediction of each image 
7). Use the trained Model 
a). Use the model to predict the label of images.
